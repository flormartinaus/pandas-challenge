In this code, we are analysing school data. The code sorts the data by school and calculates figures like total student population, school budget, per student budget, average math and reading scores, percentage of students passing math and reading, and overall passing rate.

After the analysis we can observe that:

1) When classified by school, average math and reading scores remain stable across all Year levels.  There has been no significant improvement in results from any school.
2) There is no correlation in between budget per student and passing scores, but the students with the higher budget have the lowest overall passing rate
3) The schools with fewers students <1000, have the higher overall passing rate
